Breakout #2: Building Your Processing Pipeline

Activity: Create a complete automated processing pipeline for your weather data.

Instructions:

1) Implement the WeatherProcessingPipeline for your collected data
2) Set up automated processing that runs every hour
3) Create a data quality monitoring system with custom thresholds
4) Build a simple dashboard showing processing status and data quality metrics
5) Test the entire pipeline with your weather data

Expected Output:

1) A working automated processing pipeline
2) Quality monitoring with alerting capabilities
3) Processed datasets ready for analysis and visualization
4) Documentation of your processing workflow

Discussion Points:

1) What quality thresholds are appropriate for your use case?
2) How would you handle processing failures in a production environment?
3) What additional derived features would be valuable for your application?
