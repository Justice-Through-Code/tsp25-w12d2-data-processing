Breakout #1: Data Quality Assessment

Activity: In your groups, assess the quality of your collected weather data and create cleaning strategies.

Instructions:

1) Load your weather data from yesterday's collection into a pandas DataFrame

2) Use the WeatherDataProcessor to generate a comprehensive quality report

3) Create visualizations showing data quality issues in your dataset

4) Develop a cleaning strategy for any issues you discover

5) Document the most significant quality problems you found

Expected Output:

1) A detailed data quality report for your weather dataset
2) Visualizations highlighting quality issues
3) A documented cleaning strategy
4) A cleaned version of your dataset

Discussion Points:

1) What were the most common data quality issues in your dataset?
2) How did the quality vary between different cities or time periods?
3) Which cleaning strategies would be most appropriate for your data?






Breakout #2: Building Your Processing Pipeline

Activity: Create a complete automated processing pipeline for your weather data.

Instructions:

1) Implement the WeatherProcessingPipeline for your collected data
2) Set up automated processing that runs every hour
3) Create a data quality monitoring system with custom thresholds
4) Build a simple dashboard showing processing status and data quality metrics
5) Test the entire pipeline with your weather data

Expected Output:

1) A working automated processing pipeline
2) Quality monitoring with alerting capabilities
3) Processed datasets ready for analysis and visualization
4) Documentation of your processing workflow

Discussion Points:

1) What quality thresholds are appropriate for your use case?
2) How would you handle processing failures in a production environment?
3) What additional derived features would be valuable for your application?
